1
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,640
The trial of the demon Crowley,

2
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,040
beginning with evidence
and ending with utter obliviation,

3
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,880
is in session.

4
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,000
All rise.

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,880
Bring in the traitor.

6
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,120
Hey, guys.

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,240
Nice place you got here.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,880
Not for you, it won't be.

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,376
Could do with some house plants.

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,160
- Maybe a coffee table.
- Silence!

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,440
The prisoner shall approach.

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,320
Love to.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,160
So, four of us.

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,920
Rubber of bridge?
Barbershop quartet?

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,080
The trial of a traitor.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,680
Lord Beelzebub, you are...?

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
I'm the judge.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,560
And I'm the prosecutor.

19
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,360
And so Dagon here is defending me?

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,280
Oh, I'm afraid not.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,840
No, I'm just here in case
there's anything you've done

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,560
that they forgot.

23
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,120
But we built this place for you specially.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,240
It shall be your place of trial.

25
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,720
And it shall be your place of destruction.

26
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,960
Guys, you shouldn't have gone
to all the trouble.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,200
What appears to be the problem?

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,880
You wouldn't get that sort
of performance from a modern car.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,080
Crowley?

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Hey, Aziraphale!
I see you found a ride.

31
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,000
- Nice dress. Suits you.
- Ahh!

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,960
This young man won't let us in.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,560
Leave it to me.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,560
Army human,

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,680
my friend and I have come
a long way, and...

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,320
Which one of you did that?

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Okay, those kids are in big trouble.

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,880
And so are you people.
Don't move!

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,560
Ninety years and not a scratch,

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,280
now look at you.

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,520
Crowley. He's got a gun.

42
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,520
He's pointing it.
Do something!

43
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,960
I am having a moment here.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,560
Crowley!

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,560
I am the nice one.

46
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,800
You can't expect me to do the dirty work.

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,600
I'm going to count to three,
then I'm going to use my finger.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,280
Ma'am, I'm giving you all five
seconds to vacate this area!

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,800
Rest in peace.

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,720
You were a good car.

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,560
- Nice work on the soldier.
- Well...

52
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,280
Oh, I do hope I haven't sent him
somewhere unpleasant.

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,600
Oh. Okay.

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,880
I need to get over the car thing.

55
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,200
I'll deal with them.

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,520
Never fear, laddie.

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,920
I've got a finger.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
You may need to brandish
your weapon, Sergeant Shadwell.

59
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
We are here to lick some serious butt.

60
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,920
"Kick", Aziraphale.
It's "kick butt".

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,240
For Heaven's sake.

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Oh! I can't believe I just said that.

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,920
Oi, Young.

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,320
Yes?

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,040
- Your son, Adam.
- What's he done now?

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,080
I've just seen him
and his little gang of cronies

67
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,720
cycling to the Air Force base.

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,240
If you think that
armed guards and whatnot

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,600
will tolerate your son's tomfoolery,

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,016
- I, for one, do not.
- Adam wouldn't...

71
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,240
You saw what he did to my begonias.

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
Don't blame me if your son
starts World War Three.

73
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,920
- Where exactly are we going?
- Shh!

74
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,360
In a handful of moments,
the missiles will fly.

75
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,160
The forces of Heaven and Hell will attack.

76
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,280
And everything depends
on one small boy.

77
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Silence holds the bubble
of the world in its grip.

78
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Those people,
do you think they were terrorists?

79
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,240
In a very nice
and accurate way...

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,000
yes.

81
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,920
I mean, you should have seen their auras.

82
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,176
Was there a problem with them?

83
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,520
Negative.

84
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Like black holes.

85
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
I don't think they're entirely human.

86
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,080
If only we knew what they were saying.

87
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,000
We no longer have control
of the ACME-6 nuclear launch protocols!

88
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,440
I think we've been hacked!

89
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,480
Nuclear strike orders implemented...

90
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,920
against Belgium.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,880
Are you sure this is a good idea?

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,440
Look, we're trying
to turn off the controls,

93
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,256
but there's some kind
of satellite override in place!

94
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,320
Are you sure this is a good idea?

95
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,600
They're saying it's the end of the world.

96
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,880
Yes, I got that.

97
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
It has begun.

98
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,040
I didn't ask for it to begin.

99
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,040
Your very existence
demands the ending of the world.

100
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,040
You could finish this for them
with one thought.

101
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,600
You can make the world anew.

102
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,840
That's him. The curly one.

103
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
Shoot him. Save the world.

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,760
You are part of us, not them.
No one will disobey you.

105
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,480
What? He's just a wee bairn.
You cannae...

106
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,496
- Oh, for Heaven's sake.
- Oh, no.

107
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Give me that.

108
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Ignore this nonsense.

109
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,240
A word from you
and I will end their lives.

110
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,880
You can't just shoot children!

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,120
Perhaps we should wait.

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,640
What, till he grows up?
Shoot him, Aziraphale!

113
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,400
I couldn't let you do it.

115
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,240
Excuse me, why are you two people?

116
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,280
Uh, long story.

117
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,280
- You see, I was in my bookshop...
- It's not right.

118
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,760
You should go back to being
two separate people again.

119
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,600
Oh, made me go all tingly.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,200
But we have to be able
to do something.

121
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,040
We're not in a movie.

122
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,416
There's no handy little red wire
to cut to stop the countdown.

123
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,760
Hmm. Agnes, do you have better ideas?

124
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,936
You're not gonna be able to shut
down 21st century technology

125
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,480
with some random 17th century prediction.

126
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,960
"He is not what he says he is."

127
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Agnes, you're not even trying.

128
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,520
Weapons activation in two minutes.

129
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
What does that even mean?

130
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,720
I don't know.

131
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,040
- Tell me.
- I think it's about me.

132
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,240
Hmm?

133
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,120
I am not technically

134
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,440
a computer engineer.

135
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,440
I'd like to be.

136
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,600
But I'm actually just...

137
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,880
- Just?
- Just...

138
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
- Just? Just what?
- Just the opposite.

139
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm rubbish with computers. Every time
I try to make them work, they break.

140
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,760
We're doomed.

142
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,400
It was time to decide
who your friends were.

143
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,520
And Adam had.

144
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,440
So, the Antichrist,
three human children

145
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,600
and a former Hell Hound,
faced Death

146
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,040
and three monsters who came
from the minds of humanity.

147
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,040
The thing is,
they're not actually real.

148
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,200
They're just like nightmares, really.

149
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,160
Little boys with your toys.

150
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,960
I'm not a boy.

151
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,080
I am War.

152
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,680
You were made to serve me,

153
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,040
to live in me and die in me.

154
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,320
My mum says that war
is just masculine imperialism

155
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,440
executed on a global stage.

156
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,240
A little girl.

157
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,200
Run home and play
with your dollies, little girl.

158
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,280
I do not endorse

159
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,120
everyday sexism.

160
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,640
Ow! Oh!

161
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,600
We're Adam's real friends.

162
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
Not you lot.

163
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,880
You're a joke.

164
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,360
Just say what you believe, Pepper.

165
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,840
I believe in peace, bitch.

166
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,600
Drop it, Pepper. Quick.

167
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,800
I believe in a clean world.

168
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,080
And I believe in food
and a healthy lunch.

169
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,840
Actually, it's a very good thing.

170
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,520
Didn't that used to be your sword?

171
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,080
I do believe it was.

172
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
Any moment now.

173
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Encourage the troops, Dagon.

174
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,560
Right. Listen up.

175
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,960
Any moment now, we'll be leaving Hell

176
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,400
and we'll be going up against
the army of angels.

177
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,560
Now, all of you were angels once,

178
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,520
and we fought in the glorious revolution.

179
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,240
And we lost.
But that was then.

180
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,160
We have had thousands of years

181
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,160
- to get tougher.
- Tougher!

182
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
- Smarter.
- Smarter!

183
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,960
And more dangerous.

184
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,600
I want you to repeat after me.

185
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
- Tougher.
- Tougher!

186
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,480
- Smarter.
- Smarter!

187
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Something's happening.

188
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,520
Something's wrong.

189
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
- We're idiots.
- Thirty seconds...

190
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,640
- Look. Repair it.
- What?

191
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,120
Get this computer room
working better, right now.

192
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,400
You said every computer
you try and fix dies,

193
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,960
so... fix it.

194
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,880
And speed up nuclear Armageddon?

195
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,240
Could you? Speed it up?

196
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,720
Yeah.

197
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,680
Easy. I mean, if I actually wanted
to improve this computer's performance,

198
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,280
all I'd do is open it up
and then click on the disk defragmenter.

199
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,440
All over the world,

200
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,360
people who had been wrestling
with switches

201
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,760
found that they had switched.

202
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,240
Circuit breakers opened.

203
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Computers stopped planning
World War Three

204
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,200
and went back to idly scanning
the stratosphere.

205
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
Death, this all has to stop now.

206
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,760
It has stopped.
But they will be back.

207
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,760
We are never far away.

208
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,920
I am creation's shadow.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,760
You cannot destroy me,

210
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,280
that would destroy the world.

211
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
Good day, gentlemen.

212
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,760
Cheek.

213
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,280
Cheek.

214
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,480
Death opened wings of night.

215
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,080
Wings that were shapes cut
through the matter of creation

216
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,160
into the darkness beneath,

217
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,760
and in which, distant lights glimmered.

218
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,560
Lights that may have been stars,

219
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,440
or may have been
something entirely else.

220
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,840
There. You see, Crowley?

221
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,520
- It's like I've always said...
- Oh, it isn't over.

222
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,080
Nothing's over.

223
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,560
Both Heaven and Hell
still want their war.

224
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
You. Boy.

225
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,680
Antichrist, what was your name again?

226
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,040
Adam Young.

227
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,896
So your friends got together
and saved the world.

228
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,960
Well done. Have a gold star.
Won't make any difference.

229
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,280
You!

230
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,200
You're the man in the car.
You stole my book.

231
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,720
Oh, book girl. Catch.

232
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,040
What is going on out here?

233
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,440
Long story. No time.

234
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,240
- Well, try me.
- Uh...

235
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,800
Okay, so, uh...

236
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,680
in the beginning, in the Garden,

237
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,400
there was... Well,
he was a wily old serpent,

238
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,440
and I was technically on apple tree duty.

239
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
Hey, Adam. Hi, Pepper.
Hi, you two.

240
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,056
Hello, Anathema. You just stopped them
blowing up the world, didn't you?

241
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,640
I guess.

242
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,560
My boyfriend here did the tricky bit.

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,320
Boyfriend?

244
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,680
Another deluded victim of the patriarchy.

245
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Ugh.

246
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,520
Lord Beelzebub.

247
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
What an honour.

248
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,040
Crowley, the traitor.

249
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,600
That's not a nice word.

250
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,456
All the other words
I have for you are worse.

251
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,160
Where's the boy?

252
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,760
That one.

253
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
Adam Young.

254
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,720
Hi.

255
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,600
Young man...

256
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,600
Armageddon must... restart.

257
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,840
Right now.

258
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
A temporary inconvenience

259
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,760
cannot get in the way
of the greater good.

260
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,400
As to what it stands in the way of,
that has yet to be decided.

261
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,960
But the battle must
be decided now, boy.

262
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,480
That is... your destiny.

263
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,320
It is written.
Now start the war.

264
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,040
You both want to end the world
just to see whose gang is best?

265
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,240
Obviously.

266
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,040
It's the Great Plan.

267
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,680
It's the entire reason
for the creation of the Earth.

268
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,560
I've got this. Adam...

269
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,000
when all this is over,

270
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,320
you're going to get to rule the world.

271
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,320
Don't you want to rule the world?

272
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,496
It's hard enough having to think
of things for Pepper and Wensley

273
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,040
and Brian to do all the time
so they don't get bored.

274
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,640
I've got all the world I want.

275
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,560
Well, you can't just refuse
to be who you are.

276
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,080
Your birth, your destiny,
they're part of the Great Plan.

277
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
Um, ahem...

278
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,680
excuse me, you keep talking
about the Great Plan.

279
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,896
Aziraphale, maybe you should
just keep your mouth shut.

280
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,216
One thing I'm not clear on.

281
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,080
Is that the Ineffable Plan?

282
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,240
The Great Plan!
It is written.

283
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,520
There shall be a world,

284
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,640
and it shall last for 6,000 years
and end in fire and flame.

285
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,400
Yes, yes, that sounds like
the Great Plan.

286
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,920
Just wondering,
is that the Ineffable Plan as well?

287
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
Well, they're the same thing.

288
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,560
You don't know.

289
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,280
Uh...

290
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,296
well, it'd be a pity
if you'd thought you were doing

291
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,720
what the Great Plan said,

292
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,320
but you were actually going
directly against God's Ineffable Plan.

293
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,080
I mean, everyone knows the Great Plan,
yeah? But the Ineffable Plan...

294
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,720
is... well, it's ineffable, isn't it?

295
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,480
By definition, we can't know it.

296
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,800
But it is... written.

297
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,320
God does not play games
with the universe.

298
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,160
Where have you been?

299
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Can I just...?

300
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,880
Um...

301
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm going to need to talk to...
Head Office.

302
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,800
How I am supposed to get
10 million angels to stand down

303
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
from their war footing is...

304
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,800
It doesn't bear thinking about.

305
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,376
You should try to get 10 million demons

306
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,760
to put down their weapons
and go back to work.

307
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,280
Well, at least we know whose fault it is.

308
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,040
Young man...

309
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,800
you were put on this Earth
for one reason and one reason only.

310
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
To end it.

311
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,880
You're a disobedient little brat.

312
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,400
And I hope someone tells your father.

313
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,200
Oh, they will.

314
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,280
And your father will not be pleased.

315
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,520
Weren't they odd?

316
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,640
No! No!

317
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,680
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

318
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,800
What's happening?
I can feel something.

319
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,520
They did it.

320
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,880
They told his father.

321
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,560
Oh, no.

322
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,680
And his Satanic father is not happy.

323
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Perhaps it's a volcano.

324
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,800
No, there aren't any volcanoes in England.

325
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,280
It's really angry, whatever it is.
I can feel it.

326
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
It's getting closer.

327
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,320
- What's happening?
- Well, you can call me an old silly,

328
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,800
but it looks like the devil is coming,
Satan himself.

329
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,776
- Oh.
- Oh, that's the way it is, is it?

330
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,240
Anyone wants to hurt the whore of Babylon
is going to have to get past me.

331
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,240
Oh, Mr Shadwell.

332
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,160
Right. That was that.

333
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,080
It was nice knowing you.

334
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,560
We can't give up now.

335
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,240
This is Satan himself.

336
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,000
It isn't about Armageddon.
This is personal.

337
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
We are fucked!

338
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,080
Come up with something or...

339
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,240
or I'll never talk to you again.

340
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,560
Ahh.

341
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
Adam, listen,

342
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,440
your father is coming to destroy you.

343
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,200
Probably to destroy all of us.

344
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,720
My dad?
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

345
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,440
Not your Earthly father.
Satan.

346
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,080
Your father who is no longer in Heaven.

347
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,960
He is coming, and he is angry.

348
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,720
So, what do you want me to do about it?

349
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,680
Fight him?

350
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,320
I don't think fighting him
would do any good.

351
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
You're going to have to come up
with something else.

352
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,800
But I'm just a kid.

353
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,280
But that's not a bad thing to be, Adam.

354
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,240
You know, I was scared
that you'd be Hell incarnate.

355
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,880
I hoped you'd be Heaven incarnate.

356
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,000
But you're not either of those things.

357
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,040
You're much better.

358
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,040
You're human incarnate.

359
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,520
Adam, reality will listen to you right now.
You can change things.

360
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,200
And whatever happens,
for good or for evil...

361
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,080
we're beside you.

362
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,960
I'm going to start time.

363
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,280
You won't have long to do
whatever you're going to do.

364
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,040
Do it quickly.

365
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,320
Oh!

366
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,960
Oh...

367
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,440
Where is my son?

368
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,720
You? You're my rebellious son?

369
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,960
Come here.

370
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,920
You're not my dad.

371
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,280
Dads don't wait
until you're 11 to say hello,

372
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,960
- and then turn up to tell you off.
- What?

373
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,880
If I'm in trouble with my dad...

374
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,120
...then it won't be you.

375
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,240
It's going to be the dad who was there.

376
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,000
You're not my dad.

377
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,160
What did you say?

378
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,280
You can do it.

379
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,040
Say it, Adam.
Say it again!

380
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,160
Come here.

381
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,680
You're not my dad.

382
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
You never were.

383
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
No.

384
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,560
No, no, no, no, no, no!

385
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,800
No!

386
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
Adam? Adam?

387
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,760
That's not really his father.

388
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,040
- Oh, for Heaven's sake. Where is he?
- It is.

389
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,480
It is now.

390
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,640
And it always was.

391
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,040
He did it.

392
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,840
Adam!

393
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,840
Would anyone here care
to explain to me

394
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,000
what exactly is going on?

395
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
It's all worked out
for the best, though.

396
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,840
Just imagine how awful it might have been
if we'd been at all competent.

397
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
Point taken.

398
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,960
What's that?

399
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,760
It fell out of Agnes Nutter's book.

400
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,560
"For soon enough
you will be playing with fire"?

401
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,600
So this is the final one
of Agnes' prophecies?

402
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,760
As far as I know.

403
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,520
Hmm. And Adam... human again?

404
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,800
As far as I can tell, yes.

405
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,640
Angel...

406
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,760
what if the Almighty planned it
like this all along?

407
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,320
From the very beginning?

408
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
Could have.

409
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,800
I wouldn't put it past her.

410
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,960
You got the, um...?

411
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,440
Ah, didn't want them falling
into the wrong hands.

412
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,560
Oh, excuse me, gents. There's, uh...
there's meant to be a sword in here.

413
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,360
Oh. There is.

414
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,040
Yeah. Sitting on it.

415
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,560
Good thing you were here, really.

416
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,160
How nice to have someone
who recognises our part

417
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,880
- in saving the...
- I need someone to sign for it.

418
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,200
Oh, right.

419
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Do you believe in life after death?

420
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I suppose I must do.

421
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,840
Yeah.

422
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,160
If I was to tell my wife
what happened to me today,

423
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,000
she wouldn't believe me.

424
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,720
And I wouldn't blame her.

425
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,680
Oh. There it is.

426
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,520
It says "Oxford" on the front.

427
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
Yeah, but he'll drive to London anyway.

428
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,120
He just won't know why.

429
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,560
I suppose I should get him
to drop me off at the bookshop.

430
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,000
It burned down, remember?

431
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,640
You can stay at my place, if you like.

432
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,840
I don't think my side would like that.

433
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,680
You don't have a side anymore.

434
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,280
Neither of us do.

435
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,920
We're on our own side.

436
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,960
Like Agnes said, we are going
to have to choose our faces wisely.

437
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,360
Adam had rebooted reality.

438
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
He had changed the past
and changed the present.

439
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,720
So on Sunday, people woke
to find a world that was almost,

440
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,080
but not entirely,

441
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,560
the one that they used to inhabit.

442
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,160
Although people who were dead
were now alive.

443
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,840
And things that were broken
had now been miraculously restored.

444
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,760
Those are new.

445
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,040
Mum, I've tidied it.

446
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,440
Oh!

447
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Well, was that so hard?
I can see the carpet.

448
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Now you just have to keep it clean.

449
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
Can Dog and me go outside?

450
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,000
You know what your father said.

451
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,000
He said that even if he didn't know
why I was in trouble, I would.

452
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,880
And?

453
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,120
Was he right?

454
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,360
Can you explain it to me?

455
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,600
Well, you can go into the garden,

456
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,920
give Dog a little exercise,
but that is all.

457
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,400
Thanks, Mum. Come on, Dog.

458
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Good morning.

459
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
Oh, I'm gonna regret asking this...

460
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,960
but I'm gonna ask.

461
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,720
Why is your car called "Dick Turpin"?

462
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,240
Um, well...

463
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
Dick Turpin's a famous highwayman.

464
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,960
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a sort of joke.

465
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,880
Yeah?

466
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,520
Well, it's called Dick Turpin

467
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,560
because everywhere it goes,

468
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,320
it holds up traffic.

469
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,720
Oh, I regret asking.

470
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,960
Hey...

471
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,520
Witchfinder Private
Not-a-Computer-Engineer...

472
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,600
did we save the world yesterday?

473
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,960
I don't know.

474
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,560
Hmm.

475
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,280
You're a pretty good Witchfinder, though.

476
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,200
I mean, you found me.

477
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,480
As far as the British
government is concerned,

478
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,480
the apparent appearance
of the legendary monster the Kraken

479
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,600
was a mass hallucination.

480
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,880
There were a number
of mass hallucinations

481
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,720
in our country too.

482
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,880
Yes, only this one
ate our trade delegation.

483
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,200
A strawberry lolly

484
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,440
and a vanilla with a flake, please.

485
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,560
How's the car?

486
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,240
Not a scratch on it.

487
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,520
How's the bookshop?

488
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,960
Not a smudge.

489
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,960
Not a book burned.

490
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,720
Everything back just the way it was.

491
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,280
You heard from your people yet?

492
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,720
- Yours?
- Nothing.

493
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,680
Do you understand
what happened yesterday?

494
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,000
Well, I understand some of it.

495
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,280
But some of it...

496
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,320
well, it's just a little bit too...

497
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,800
Ineffable.

498
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,880
Oh, that... that's funny, seeing him here.
That's meant to be bad luck.

499
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,240
It's meant to be bad...

500
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,120
Renegade angels all tied up
with strings.

501
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,840
These are a few
of our favourite things.

502
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,600
- Stop! Stop them!
- What's wrong, love?

503
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,080
Ooh, bad luck, dear.

504
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,760
It's not a problem.
It's tickety-boo.

505
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
Ah.

506
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,680
Aziraphale.

507
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,880
So glad you could join us.

508
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,760
You could have just sent a message.

509
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,920
I mean, a kidnapping in broad daylight.

510
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,920
Call it what it was:
an extraordinary rendition.

511
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,280
Now, have we heard
from our new associate?

512
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,440
He's on his way.

513
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,600
He's on his way.
I think you're going to like this.

514
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,920
I really do.

515
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I bet you didn't see this one coming.

516
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,240
...and the murderer of a fellow demon,

517
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,640
a crime I saw with my own eyes.

518
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,520
Creatures of Hell,

519
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,160
you have heard the evidence
against the demon

520
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,480
known as Crowley.

521
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,360
What is your verdict?

522
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,520
Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

523
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,056
Do you have anything to say

524
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,960
before we take our vengeance on you?

525
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,640
What's it to be?

526
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,520
An eternity in the deepest pit?

527
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,280
No, we're going
to do something even worse.

528
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,720
Letting the punishment fit the crime.

529
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,480
The Archangel Michael?

530
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,320
That's unlikely.

531
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,360
Cooperation with our old enemies.

532
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
Well, wank-wings, you brought the stuff?

533
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,440
I did.

534
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,040
I'll be back to collect it.

535
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,880
No, I think perhaps you
ought to do the honours. It's...

536
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,440
I've seen what that stuff can do.

537
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,520
You don't get this view
down in the basement.

538
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
That's holy water.

539
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,280
The holiest, yes.

540
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,320
Uh, it's not that we don't trust you,
Michael, but obviously we don't trust you.

541
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,960
- Hastur, test it.
- Hmm.

542
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,920
What the hell do you think you're doing?

543
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,360
Oh, ow!

544
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,880
Ahh!

545
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,600
No. No, no, no.
What have I done?

546
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,360
- No, no! Please!
- Wrong place. Wrong time.

547
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,360
Please! Please! No!

548
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,000
Demon Crowley,

549
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,040
I sentence you to extinction
by holy water.

550
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,920
Have you anything to say?

551
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
Well, yes.

552
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,080
Um...

553
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,120
this is a new jacket,
and I'd hate to ruin it.

554
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,400
Do you mind if I take it off?

555
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,640
Just leave the plate outside the door.

556
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,960
Hello, Mr S.

557
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,640
Yes, Jezebel?

558
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,640
I was just thinking...

559
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,920
after all we've been through
the past couple of days,

560
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,200
it seems a bit silly for me
to leave the plate outside the door,

561
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,320
so I've laid a place
for you at the table.

562
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,280
In your den of iniquity?

563
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
Mm-hmm.

564
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,840
Oh.

565
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,760
Oh. Oh.

566
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,160
Mr Pull-zifer?

567
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,160
- Pulsifer.
- Pulsifer?

568
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,040
Well, I... I have the peculiar honour

569
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,440
of bringing you and Mrs Pulsifer
a small bequest.

570
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,280
There isn't a Mrs Pulsifer.

571
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,640
Well, other than my mum,
but she's in Dorking.

572
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,080
How odd.
The letter is quite specific.

573
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,640
- Can I come in?
- Uh...

574
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,960
Coffee?

575
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,640
Oh, I mustn't.

576
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,000
To be honest,
we're all very interested in this.

577
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,000
Mr Bychance nearly came down himself,

578
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,200
but he doesn't travel well these days.

579
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,440
I have no idea what you're talking about.

580
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,880
The bequest.

581
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,760
It's what's in the box with the letter.

582
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,280
My firm has had it for over 300 years.

583
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,440
Master Robey?

584
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,920
This is for you, from my mother.

585
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,160
And this with it for safekeeping.

586
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,360
The letter contained
his instructions, a gold coin,

587
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,480
and five interesting facts
about the next 10 years,

588
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,000
which would ensure
that he was able to pursue

589
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,480
a very successful legal career.

590
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,920
All he had to do in return
was see that the box

591
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,760
was carefully looked after
for several centuries,

592
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,640
and then be delivered on this
particular Sunday morning.

593
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,840
And well... here it is.

594
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
It's from Agnes.

595
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,280
- Are you sure?
- I recognise the style.

596
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,280
- I'm Anathema.
- Baddicombe.

597
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,520
Well, should we see what's inside?

598
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,160
We've been having bets in the office.

599
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,040
Would you like to open it?

600
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,080
Oh, I say, that would be something
to tell the grandchildren.

601
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,400
That's odd.

602
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,640
That's my name, I...

603
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,640
Excuse me, I...

604
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,080
"Here is a florin, lawyer.

605
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
Now run fast, lest the world
find out the truth

606
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,520
about you and Mistress Spiddon
of the council town planning department."

607
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,440
"Further Nice and Accurate
Prophecies of Agnes Nutter,

608
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,880
Concerning the World That Is to Come.

609
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,000
Ye Saga Continues."

610
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,040
You know,
I've got a tidy amount put away.

611
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,680
Sometimes I think it would be
nice to move out of London.

612
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,160
Get a little bungalow.

613
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,600
And they say two can live
as cheaply as one.

614
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,480
And it would be nice
to have a man around.

615
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,080
Uh, well, I don't think
Private Pulsifer is ever coming back.

616
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,560
I'm the only Witchfinder left.

617
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,200
And you found me.

618
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,120
I'm not much of a witch,
but... I'll have to do.

619
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,040
Now what?

620
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,880
I...

621
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,280
I suppose now, I, uh...

622
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,680
I pop the question?

623
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,440
Yeah. Go on, then.

624
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,000
Aye.

625
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,920
How many nipples have you got, Jezebel?

626
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,880
Retired Jezebel, Mr S.

627
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,360
Just the two.

628
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,840
Well...

629
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,600
that's alright then.

630
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,080
So, with one act of treason,

631
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,120
you averted the war.

632
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,800
Well, I think the greater good...

633
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,656
Don't talk to me about
the greater good, sunshine.

634
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,680
I'm the Archangel fucking Gabriel.

635
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,320
The greater good was we were
finally going to settle things

636
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,640
with the opposition once and for all.

637
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,640
Up.

638
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,000
I don't suppose I can
persuade you to reconsider?

639
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
We're meant to be the good guys,
for Heaven's sake.

640
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,640
Well, for Heaven's sake,

641
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,920
we are meant to make
examples out of traitors.

642
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,680
So... into the flame.

643
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,600
Right.

644
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,600
Well... lovely knowing you all.

645
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
May we meet on a better occasion.

646
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,560
Shut your stupid mouth and die already.

647
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,520
I don't suppose that anywhere
in the nine circles of Hell

648
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,480
there's such a thing as a rubber duck?

649
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,920
No?

650
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,560
Ahh...

651
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Mmm.

652
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,000
It may be worse than we thought.

653
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,880
He's gone native.

654
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,720
He isn't one of us anymore.

655
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,640
What is he?

656
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,800
So, you're probably thinking,
"If he can do this,

657
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,600
I wonder what else he can do?"

658
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,480
And very, very soon,

659
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,920
you're all going to get
the chance to find out.

660
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,440
He's bluffing.
We can take him.

661
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,640
One demon against the rest of Hell?

662
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,440
- What's he going to do?
- Shut it!

663
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,000
Get him out of here,
this'll cause a riot.

664
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,040
What are you all looking at?
Nothing to see.

665
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,600
Nothing to see here.

666
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,320
I came to bring back the...

667
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,960
Oh, Lord.

668
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,680
Michael! Dude.

669
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,120
Do us a quick miracle, will you?
I need a bath towel.

670
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,480
I think it would be better for everyone

671
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,120
if I were to be left alone in the future.

672
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,640
Don't you?

673
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,720
Right.

674
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,000
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

675
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,240
I know what I'm doing.
I just... I just don't like it.

676
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,080
Technological marvels
can be revealed.

677
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,680
And you'd probably just break them.

678
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,120
Think of it this way.

679
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,600
Do you want to be a descendant
all your life?

680
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,800
Psst!

681
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,336
Your mum said we couldn't talk
to you, so we came round the back.

682
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,840
Adam, what happened last night?

683
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,840
Just stuff.
It doesn't matter.

684
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,280
All I try and do is help,
and now I'm stuck in the garden.

685
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,120
How long until they let you out?

686
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,080
Years. Years and years, I expect.

687
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,896
- What about tomorrow?
- Tomorrow will be alright.

688
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,096
They'll have forgotten about it by then.
They always do.

689
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,640
There's a circus in Norton.

690
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,016
We're going to watch them set up.

691
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:56,000
You should go. I'll be fine.

692
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,760
Dog, get away from that hedge,

693
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,080
because if you went through
I'd have to chase you to catch you,

694
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
and I'd have to leave the garden.

695
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,960
And I'm not allowed to do that.

696
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,080
But I'd have to if you went
and ran away.

697
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,080
Dog, you bad dog.

698
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,040
Stop. Come back here.

699
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,680
Something told him that
something was coming to an end.

700
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,600
Not the world exactly, just the summer.

701
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,560
There would be other summers,
but there would never be one like this.

702
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,560
Not ever again.

703
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,760
Adam Young,
get away from my apples!

704
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,080
Oi, you boy!
I'll tell your father!

705
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,240
He couldn't see why
people made such a fuss

706
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,480
about people eating their apples.

707
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,560
But life would be a lot
less fun if they didn't.

708
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,040
And there never was an apple,
in Adam's opinion,

709
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,040
that wasn't worth the trouble
you got into for eating it.

710
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,000
Do you think
they'll leave us alone now?

711
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,160
At a guess,
they'll pretend it never happened.

712
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,840
Hmm.

713
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,560
Right. Anyone looking?

714
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,120
Nobody.

715
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,640
Right. Swap back, then.

716
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,600
It was just like
Agnes had told them.

717
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,200
They were playing with fire

718
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,840
and would need to choose
their faces wisely.

719
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,360
And so they had.

720
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,160
Ah.

721
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,400
A tartan collar. Really?

722
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,040
Tartan is stylish.

723
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,440
So, Agnes Nutter's last prophecy

724
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,680
was on the money.

725
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,040
I asked them for a rubber duck

726
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,880
and made the Archangel Michael
miracle me a towel.

727
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,160
They'll leave us alone...
for a bit.

728
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,800
If you ask me, both sides
are going to use this

729
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,720
as breathing space
before the big one.

730
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,600
I thought that was the big one.

731
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,440
No. For my money,
the really big one

732
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,880
is all of us against all of them.

733
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,720
What?

734
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,360
Heaven and Hell
against... humanity?

735
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,320
Right.
Time to leave the garden.

736
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,640
Let me tempt you to a spot of lunch?

737
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,960
Temptation accomplished.

738
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,440
Hmm...
What about the Ritz?

739
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,520
I believe a table for two
has just miraculously come free.

740
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,160
Ahh...

741
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,920
I like to think none of this
would have worked out

742
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,720
if you weren't, at heart,
just a little bit a good person.

743
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,320
And if you weren't, deep down,

744
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,600
just enough of a bastard
to be worth knowing.

745
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,520
Cheers.

746
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,280
To the world.

747
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,480
To the world.

748
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,040
Perhaps the recent exertions

749
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,160
had had some fallout
in the nature of reality,

750
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,600
because while they were eating,
for the first time ever,

751
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,240
a nightingale actually did sing
in Berkeley Square.

752
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,480
Nobody heard it
over the noise of the traffic,

753
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,120
but it was there right enough.
